## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to political elections and corruption in Southeast Asia, especially the Philippines. I am also interested in data about the black market in developing countries and socio-economic conditions that people in Southeast Asia face. Further, I would like to investigate data that highlights the eocnomic performance of the various regimes that exist in Latin America.
